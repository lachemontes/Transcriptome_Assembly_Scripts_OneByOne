## Introduction

This notebook performs **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to visualize transcriptome-wide changes across your samples using TPM values from Kallisto or Salmon.
**Description of data set**

A total of 96 libraries were analyzed, including tissues from six individuals, two parts (distal/proximal), four technical replicates, and two ends.
