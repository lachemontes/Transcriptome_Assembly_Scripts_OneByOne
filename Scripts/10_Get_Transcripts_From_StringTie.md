After running StringTie for transcript assembly, you often need to convert the generated GTF files into GFF3 format. Additionally, you may want to extract the corresponding nucleotide sequences from a reference genome and save them in FASTA format. This guide outlines the commands needed to perform these tasks.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:
Anaconda or Miniconda installed.
The Cufflinks environment set up with StringTie and gffread installed.
The output file from StringTie, typically named transcripts.gtf.

```
conda activate Cufflinks
```

This command activates the Cufflinks conda environment, making sure that all necessary dependencies for working with transcriptomic data are available.

### Convert GTF to GFF3

```
gffread /path/to/your/transcripts.gtf -o transcripts.gff3
```

This command uses gffread to convert a GTF file (transcripts.gtf) generated by StringTie into GFF3 format. The resulting GFF3 file (transcripts.gff3) is used for further analysis or visualization tools that require GFF3 format.

### Parameters:

transcripts.gtf: Input GTF file generated by StringTie.
-o transcripts.gff3: Specifies the output file name for the GFF3 format.

Extract Transcripts in FASTA Format

```
gffread transcripts.gff3 -g /path/to/your/Genome/genome.fna -w transcripts.fasta
```

This command extracts the nucleotide sequences of the transcripts from the GFF3 file and outputs them in FASTA format.
